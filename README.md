# SpaceX-Falcon-9-first-stage-Landing-Prediction
In this project, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. In this module, you will be provided with an overview of the problem and the tools you need to complete the project.

## Learning Objectives ##
- Develop Python code to manipulate data in a Pandas data frame
- Convert a JSON file into a Create a Python Pandas data frame by converting a JSON file
- Create a Jupyter notebook and make it sharable using GitHub
- Utilize data science methodologies to define and formulate a real-world business problem
- Utilize your data analysis tools to load a dataset, clean it, and find interesting insights from it

## Lab 1: Collecting the data ##

### From API ###
In this lab [jupyter-labs-spacex-data-collection-api-2.ipynb](https://github.com/mlubbad/SpaceX-Falcon-9-first-stage-Landing-Prediction/blob/main/jupyter-labs-spacex-data-collection-api-2.ipynb), you will collect and make sure the data is in the correct format from an API.

### From Web Scrapping ###
In this lab [jupyter-labs-webscraping.ipynb](https://github.com/mlubbad/SpaceX-Falcon-9-first-stage-Landing-Prediction/blob/main/jupyter-labs-webscraping.ipynb), you will be performing web scraping to collect Falcon 9 historical launch records from a Wikipedia page titled [List of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Falcon_9_and_Falcon_Heavy_launches)

## Lab 2: Data wrangling ## 
In this lab [labs-jupyter-spacex-Data%20wrangling.ipynb](https://github.com/mlubbad/SpaceX-Falcon-9-first-stage-Landing-Prediction/blob/main/labs-jupyter-spacex-Data%20wrangling.ipynb), we will perform some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find some patterns in the data and determine what would be the label for training supervised models.

### Hands-on Lab: Complete the EDA with SQL ### 
*Using this lab [jupyter-labs-eda-sql-coursera_sqllite-2.ipynb](https://github.com/mlubbad/SpaceX-Falcon-9-first-stage-Landing-Prediction/blob/main/jupyter-labs-eda-sql-coursera_sqllite-2.ipynb) you will:*
- Understand the Spacex DataSet
- Load the dataset into the corresponding table in a Db2 database
- Execute SQL queries to answer assignment questions

### Hands-on Lab: EDA with Visualization Lab ###
